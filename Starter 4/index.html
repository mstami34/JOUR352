<h1>Navient Data Visualization</h1>

<i>By Michael Stamatos</i>

<div> <p>The data shows that Navientâ€™s claim that the lawsuit is unsubstantiated is false. For multiple products and issues identified in complaints by customers, there were large numbers of complaints from customers before the lawsuit, with student loan complaints being a specific example. However, after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed their lawsuit in January of 2017, the amount of complaints from customers grew exponentially with people being made aware of the negligence. The number of student loans complaints, which was 586 over a three-month period before the lawsuit, grew by almost eleven times the previous number, all the way up to 6,429 in the time from January to the end of March in 2017. </p>

<p>There were also other problems with Navient that people were having that were recognized following the lawsuit. In the time from 2012 to 2016, there were no reported issues with credit card reporting, credit repair services, or other personal reports. In 2017, in the months following the lawsuit, people started noticing problems and reports started coming in, peaking at 167 from April to the end of July. The same thing happened with smaller issues. There were no reported complaints involving bad loan information and incorrect debt collection before the lawsuit, but after the first quarter of 2017 both areas experienced an exponential increase in complaints. </p>
